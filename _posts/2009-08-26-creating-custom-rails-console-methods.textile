post_description: Create your own console only commands (methods) in rails.
---

Tired of typing the same commands in console every time you
fire it up?

The straw that breaks my back is "User.find_by_name('super_long_namesky')"

Using method missing, I'm going to make typing super_long_namesky
return its user.

All code in the directory /config/initializers is run when rails starts, so
make a new file there. /config/initializers/object.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
  class Object
    def method_missing(*args)
      method = args[0].to_s
      if @controller.class == ApplicationController && #ensures it is in console
      character = Character.find_by_l_name(method)
          character
        else
          raise NoMethodError #if all fails, it needs to raise the standard error
        end
      end
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Yes, we're adding a method to all objects; however, 
"@controller.class == ApplicationController" ensures it's being called 
on the console main object.

If method_missing finds a character, it returns it. If not or if the command 
is called outside of console, it returns the correct no method error.
